    <p>Why? Instead of telling your browser, "start at C...", which doesn't exist on Linux or OS X machines, it tells it to start from whever the web page resides. It starts navigating around the file system from wherever this page is.

Then it just continues down the path to images and finally to our image. Awww yiss.</p>
