# Adventure Text Game

## It's broken!
Can you fix it? Throughout this project, there are many comments with TODO. If you accomplish everything listed in TODOs, you should have a new game to play! :D

## How do I run it?
Either use IntelliJ to import the project and create a run configuration for Main
OR
Open up your command line, navigate to the src directory, and run
`javac org/l2csl/java/adventuretextgame/Main.java`
`java org.l2csl.java.adventuretextgame.Main`
