# git
git is a Source Control Management (SCM) system. Source control allows you to track, manage, and share changes to your code, or source. SCM makes experimentation easier by enabling you to "branch" your code so that you and others can pursue large changes without affecting the main code base. It also makes rollbacks trivial and allows you to notate changes you make to your source. Almost every developer worth her salt uses some form of SCM, be it SVN, CVS, or git. Most have come to use git due to its distributed nature, since every copy of the source repository is a full copy, and due to Github, which facilitates social coding. With Github, you can create issues in others' code, submit and receive requests to pull in others' code, and have a central, public place to show off your projects.

Long story short, if you're not using git... You should be using git.

We might have opinions.

## Advantages
* Distributed source control is sexy
* Almost ubiquitous through the development community
* Enabled Github. You should be on Github if you aren't already

## Disadvantages
* Shutup, just use it.
